# A Chatbot As a Friend

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is made for everyone that want to have a personal computer as a friend. The idea behind this project is to create a chatbot that is up to date with the new algorithm techniques. 




## Background

This project is able to solve, for instance, the problem of the solitude, in fact, everyone that need someone with which talk can trust the bot that is always available (7 days at week & 24 hours a day).


## How is it used?

The chatbot can offer a large range of discussion and as the time goes on, it will also learn which kind of people is his owner, with this, the bot is supposed to assume the correct behavior in order to improve his speech skills with the people. This bot is made for everyone that want to confide themself with someone care.

The chatbot will be able to:
* Listen and talk with the person;
* Learn which kind of person is; 
* Answer specific question (about social behavior, usefull tips, fun fact, wheather outside, calendar, etc...).

It can be used in textual mode (that is seems like a conversation with someone) or in speech mode (that is more like a phone call).


## Data sources and AI methods

For this project we'll need the necessary amount of data in order to program a correct algorithm of:

* Speech recognition;
* Natural Lenguage Processing;
* Learn from the owner;
* etc... .

We should take the data from famous online database that is also open source and up to date about this argument.

## Challenges

Of course as every project it has is own limitations. For instance, he is not able to do a lot of stuff (create an article, playing gamens,...). 

## What next?

The next step in order to maximise this bot is to create a robotic structure, in this way, we must also implement the movement and a lot of stuff that is linked to it (equilibrium, image recognition, space movement perception,...)
